# Climate AI project

## Overview

Client AI project is a web app that allows users to doing research on private data offerred by our service and get insights from it. 

General idea is to have a web app that allows users to do the following:

- Chat  with the data/file they have, our service will use LLM to complete complexity tasks and return insights/report to user
- We will also provide AI generated info/insights based on the data they have and our knowledge base
- Each user will have their own account and space to upload data and do research

You can think this is a domain specific research tool compare to perplexity or openai playground.

User should be able to check his own space and see the data he has uploaded and the insights he has generated, and also do the research again.

All data should be private and only accessible by the user himself.
